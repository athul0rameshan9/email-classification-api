# Email Classifier

This project is an email classification application built using a BERT-based model. It classifies emails into predefined categories, enabling efficient email management and automation.

---

## Approach

The email classifier leverages a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model fine-tuned for text classification tasks. BERT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model that understands the context of words in a sentence, making it highly effective for tasks like email classification.

### Key Features of the Approach:
1. **Pre-trained BERT Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face for transfer learning.
2. **Fine-tuning**: The model is fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of emails to adapt it to the specific classification task.
3. **Tokenization**: Emails are tokenized using the BERT tokenizer to convert text into input IDs and attention masks.
4. **Multi-class Classification**: The model predicts the probability of each email belonging to one of the predefined categories.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Emails are cleaned to remove unnecessary characters, HTML tags, and stopwords.
   - Tokenization is performed using the BERT tokenizer to prepare the input for the model.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A pre-trained BERT model is fine-tuned on the labeled dataset.
   - The training process optimizes the model's weights using a cross-entropy loss function.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated on a validation dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size are tuned for optimal performance.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The trained model is integrated into a FastAPI application for serving predictions.
   - Docker is used to containerize the application for easy deployment.

## Implementation Details

### Project Structure
- `app.py`: The main FastAPI application that serves the email classification API.
- `bert-email-classifier/`: Contains the BERT model configuration, tokenizer, and vocabulary files.
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration for building the Docker image.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- `data/`: Directory for storing training and validation datasets (not included in the repository).

### Running the Application

#### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- Python 3.9 or later (if running locally without Docker)
- `pip` for managing Python dependencies

#### Using Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t email-classifier .
